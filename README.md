## FAQs

#### Is there a free trial?

Yes, you can use the plugin for 14 days after which you would need to purchase a one-time membership. It includes all features and upgrades within a year from purchase.

#### I'm having issues with my account. How do I get in touch?

For questions related directly to your account such as billing and upgrades, you can email me directly at printshop[at]artivilla.com.

#### I don't see the artboard or the grids when I hit create?

You need to enable `Show layout grids` by hitting shift+G or finding it in the figma quick menu bar UI3 panel (cmd+k). The frame gets created in the middle of the artboard so you might need to zoom out or move to the center of the canvas. This is a known bug.

#### How do I manage my presets?

Also a missing feature that will be added in upcoming releases.
